            I care deeply about working on teams that are focused, aligned, and
            customer-driven. Iâ€™m most at home designing and delivering systems
            that solve real problems â€” with code thatâ€™s fast, clear, and built
            to last.

            Most recently, I was Engineering Director at Wreno, where I led
            development of an AI-powered Credentialing API â€” from designing the
            OpenAPI infrastructure to building document classification,
            extraction, and verification systems at scale. Before that, I was a
            Software Engineer II at Amazon, where I built high-performance ad
            tooling used across internal teams.
